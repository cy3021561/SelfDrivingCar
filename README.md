## Overview

A course project developed for the Udemy course "Artificial Intelligence A-Z™ 2023: Build an AI with ChatGPT4
." This project focuses on building a mini self-driving car from scratch using Deep Q-Learning (DQN). The AI agent will learn to navigate an environment containing a map, a car, and various features using DQN, a powerful deep reinforcement learning algorithm. By training the AI agent with experience replay and different action selection policies, the mini self-driving car will demonstrate its ability to make informed decisions and drive autonomously.

## Project Plan

1. **Deep Q-Learning Intuition (Learning):** The project will introduce the fundamentals of Deep Q-Learning, where the AI agent learns by exploring and exploiting its environment to optimize its driving behavior.

2. **Deep Q-Learning Intuition (Acting):** Participants will understand the practical implementation of the DQN algorithm, where the AI agent takes actions based on its learned Q-values to drive the car.

3. **Experience Replay:** The course covers the concept of experience replay, where the AI agent stores and reuses past experiences to improve learning efficiency and stability.

4. **Action Selection Policies:** Participants will explore different action selection policies, such as ε-greedy and softmax, to balance exploration and exploitation during training.

## What I've Learned

Through the development of the mini self-driving car using DQN, participants will gain practical experience and knowledge in the following areas:

1. **Deep Reinforcement Learning:** Students will learn about the principles of deep reinforcement learning and its application in creating autonomous driving agents.

2. **DQN Algorithm:** The project will introduce Deep Q-Learning and its implementation to enable the mini self-driving car to navigate the environment effectively.

3. **Environment Building:** Participants will gain insights into building the environment containing the map, the car, and all the features required for the self-driving car.

4. **Experience Replay:** The project showcases the importance of experience replay in enhancing the AI agent's learning process and performance.
